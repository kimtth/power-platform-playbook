## Power apps - Model-driven app

 - Tables and Business flows

 The model-driven app does not provide various UI controls and customization compared to the canvas app. It focuses on business flow and simple visualization.

# Export solution to another environment

Export the unmanaged solution(s) from your development environment as managed. More information: [Export solutions](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/export-solutions) and [Power platform export solutions](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/power-platform/blob/main/power-platform/alm/move-from-unmanaged-managed-alm.md)

# Trouble shooting

- Issue: 
> After importing a solution, during opening a model-driven app, the error displays "this account is not Member Of Org".

- Solution: When you import a flow from one environment to another environment (not in same Org), the connection to a action in your flow would not be updated to the new instance automatically. You must update the connection to the action in your flow manually.

Currently, there is no way to update the connection of a action in a flow automatically from one Organization to another Organization.
